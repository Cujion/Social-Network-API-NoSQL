## Description
* This is a NoSQL Social Network BackEnd API using MongoDB and Mongoose. In this application you learn how to setup models using MongoDB in order to structure your data. Once you have your data models setup you can begin setting up your routes and controllers in order to display the correct data using insomnia. All of your controllers are then setup in a module.exports where they then get pulled into your routes and then define how your routing for each function is going to be called from.
